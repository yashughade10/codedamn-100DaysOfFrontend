Instructions :- 
    Specificity in CSS
    In this lab, you will learn about specificity in CSS.

    Specificity is an important concept when it comes to styling elements because it determines which CSS rule applied to an element is more specific and, as a result, takes precedence.

    To complete this lab, you will create three paragraph elements, apply styles based on the class selector, use inline styling, and change the specificity of the CSS rules.

    This lab will help you understand the hierarchy and importance of specificity in CSS, as well as how you can combine different selectors to achieve the desired result.

Challenges :- 
    1] Create an HTML file with 3 paragraph elements. Assign a class p-text to each of them and give them text 'This is paragraph'.

    2] Create a CSS file and apply styling to the .p-text class with the color red.

    3] Add inline styles to the second paragraph to make the text blue.

    4] Increase the specificity of the .p-text class by using the element selector in CSS to make text green. The second paragraph should remain blue.
