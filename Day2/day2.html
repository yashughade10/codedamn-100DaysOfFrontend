    Meta Tags Lab
    In this lab, you'll practice adding meta tags to the head section of an HTML document. Meta tags provide information about the web page, such as its title, description, and viewport settings. You will create the following meta tags:

    1] A meta tag with the name attribute set to viewport and content attribute set to width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0
    2] A meta tag with the name attribute set to description and add relevant content. Add a minimum of 5 words here.
    3] A meta tag with the
        -http-equiv attribute set to Content-Type and
        -content attribute set to text/html; charset='utf-8
    4] A meta tag with the property attribute set to og:title and content attribute set to Meta Tags Lab.

    Now that you're are aware about the challenges that you have to, you should also understand what these tags and mean and how do they affect the quality of your webpage when shared across the web.
